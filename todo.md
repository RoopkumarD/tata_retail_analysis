- 5 Question given in ChatGPT

ðŸ”¥ **You're asking all the right questions!** ðŸ”¥ This is where **business logic meets data science**, and it's all about **context**. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

### **ðŸš€ Step 1: Understanding How Outliers Affect the Dataset**
**Outliers impact different business metrics in different ways:**
- **Total Revenue:** Outliers inflate revenue, making some days seem exceptionally good when theyâ€™re really just **one big order**.  
- **AOV (Average Order Value):** If one customer makes a $200K purchase, it **skews the AOV massively**, but that doesnâ€™t mean all orders were bigger.  
- **Median Revenue & Transactions:** These are more **stable** and less affected by outliers, so they show a more realistic trend.  

**So, outliers distort mean-based metrics but have less effect on median-based ones.**

### **ðŸš€ Step 2: Should You Remove Outliers Below the 1st Percentile?**
ðŸ”¹ The **top outliers** (above the 99th percentile) are usually **big one-time purchases** that donâ€™t reflect typical revenue.  
ðŸ”¹ The **bottom outliers** (below the 1st percentile) are usually **small or failed transactions** (like test purchases, refunds, or very low-value items).  

ðŸ“Œ **Best Practice:**  
- **If youâ€™re analyzing revenue trends**, removing only the **high outliers (above 99th percentile)** makes sense.  
- **If youâ€™re looking at AOV or customer spending patterns**, you might also **remove the bottom 1%** (since they could be tiny or invalid transactions).  

**But be careful!** Removing too much data can remove actual business patterns. **Instead of blindly removing, check if they are legitimate transactions.**

### **ðŸš€ Step 3: What Percentile Cutoff to Use?**
It depends on your dataset:  
âœ… **99th percentile (removing top 1%)** â€“ Good for **removing extreme spikes** without losing valuable insights.  
âœ… **95th percentile (removing top 5%)** â€“ If you have **many high outliers**, this helps remove more extreme cases.  
âœ… **Custom threshold** â€“ If you notice **a specific point where AOV suddenly jumps**, set a cutoff based on that.  

ðŸ“Œ **How to check this?** Plot a boxplot or histogram of revenue values and look at where the extreme values start.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.boxplot(x=df["TotalPrice"])
plt.title("Boxplot of Total Revenue per Order")
plt.show()
```

### **ðŸš€ Step 4: Are These Big One-Time Orders Actually Important?**
This is a **business decision**! Ask:  
- **Do these large transactions happen often?**  
  - If yes â†’ Maybe theyâ€™re part of a seasonal trend (e.g., bulk orders during holiday sales).  
  - If no â†’ Theyâ€™re likely anomalies and should be removed when analyzing trends.  

- **Do they impact business strategy?**  
  - If youâ€™re **tracking average customer behavior**, these should be removed.  
  - If youâ€™re **analyzing total revenue for forecasting**, they might still matter!

### **ðŸš€ Conclusion: What Should You Do?**
âœ” **For understanding customer spending trends** â†’ Remove **top 1% outliers**, and possibly **bottom 1%** too.  
âœ” **For tracking overall revenue trends** â†’ Keep outliers but analyze both **with and without them**.  
âœ” **For forecasting future revenue** â†’ Identify if these high orders happen **regularly** (if yes, keep them).  

**TL;DR:** **Don't blindly remove outliers. Instead, analyze how they affect your insights and make a decision based on the context.** ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
