Questions the CEO Would Ask:

1. Revenue per Day and Transactions per Day – Correlation Analysis  

The business caters to both small and large purchases (wholesalers).  
To analyze the correlation between revenue and transactions per day, I will plot both metrics on the same graph, smoothing the trend using a 7-day rolling mean. To establish a positive correlation, I will first demonstrate that the rolling mean of the average order value is stable. This would indicate that revenue is primarily driven by the number of transactions. The similarity in the rise and fall of the rolling mean plots for both revenue and transactions will confirm this dependency.

2. Top Products by Revenue and Quantity  

By identifying the top 10 products based on revenue and quantity, I observe three distinct segments:  

- Premium Products: High revenue but low quantity sold (high unit price).  
- Mass Market Products: Low revenue but high quantity sold.  
- Balanced Products: A mix of both revenue and quantity.  

These insights will help the CEO in managing inventory effectively.

3. Country-wise Total Revenue and Total Products Sold  

The primary market, contributing nearly 99% of the business, is the United Kingdom, with a small share from other countries. This suggests that the business is UK-based.

4. Number of Returns  

There are instances where orders are placed and canceled within minutes, often involving large amounts. If not addressed, these transactions can distort key metrics.  
However, distinguishing between returns and cancellations is challenging. My assumption is that orders with Invoice Numbers starting with 'C' within a 9-day timeframe are cancellations, while others are genuine returns. Additionally, there are cases where a large order is placed, returned after three months, and reordered within minutes, which could distort insights. I am uncertain about the correct interpretation of this scenario.

Questions the CMO Would Ask:

1. Customer Segmentation  

Using RFM analysis, I can segment customers into categories:  

- Champion Customers & Loyal Customers – Ideal for loyalty programs.  
- At-Risk Customers – Previously high-frequency, high-spending customers who have stopped buying. The CMO should focus on re-engaging them.  
- New Customers – Potential for long-term retention through loyalty programs and special offers.

2. Best Performing Products (Revenue & Quantity)  

Identifying products with high revenue and high quantity sold allows for targeted marketing campaigns. Understanding when these products sell best can help the CMO optimize marketing strategies to outperform competitors.

3. Peak Season (Revenue / Transactions per Day)  

Identifying peak seasons will help the CMO design marketing strategies to capture more market share from competitors during high-demand periods.

4. Customer Churn Rate  

Analyzing customer churn rate helps determine how many old customers have stopped purchasing. The current churn rate is around 43% during peak months, which is a concerning figure that requires attention.
